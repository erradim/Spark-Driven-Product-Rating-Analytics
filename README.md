# Parallelized Computing Analysis

Using parallelized computing, we perform the following analysis:

- **Weakly-Rated Products**
  - A product is considered weakly rated if its average rating score is strictly less than 3.

- **Top-N Rated Products**
  - Identify the top-N rated products, where N is a program constant.

- **Statistical Analysis of Product Ratings**
  - Calculate the mean (average) and standard deviation of product ratings.
